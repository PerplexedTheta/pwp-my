        <p>Hi, I'm Jake, a programmer based in the UK 🇬🇧. I mainly contribute open-source Library projects, but do
            also contribute to other open-source projects when I'm not working.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy travelling about, getting in the sea, gigging, and often take some pictures while doing so. If
            you're interested in my ramblings, check out the blog.</p>
        <p>Peace &amp; love 🕊️</p>
