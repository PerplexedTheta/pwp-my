                <h4>Work</h4>
                <p>Most recently, I've been working remotely for PTFS Europe. We are a UK-based organisation that
                    primarily provides open-source software solutions. I mainly work with Koha and Aspen Discovery,
                    written in Perl (Koha), Java, and PHP (Aspen).</p>
                <p>Koha was my gateway into Perl whilst working at City College Plymouth, so being able to work with it
                    full-time has been great, and I've also enjoyed learning a bit of Java and PHP (both languages I
                    previously thought lowly of) when working with Aspen Discovery. üòé</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Originally from Devon, I now live on the Cornish border, by the sea, with my partner and my pet
                    blackbird (not really my pet, but he does sit in my window while I work).</p>
                <p>My interest in technology goes back to 2001, when my family bought our first desktop PC. It had a
                    533MHz Pentium III, 512 MB of memory, and a 20 GB hard disk. Pitiful by today's standard, but we
                    were the only family amongst my peers that had 1Mbps cable broadband.</p>
                <p>This beige box opened up a line to family members both in the UK, and Ireland. It also allowed me to
                    tinker with the machine, install new software, and discover all the Internet had to offer.</p>
                <p>Since 2021, I've been working in this industry I've spent my whole life aspiring towards. Initially
                    this was as a technician, but since 2024 I've been working full-time as a developer, love every
                    moment of my work.</p>

                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p><strong>Mac</strong> machines are my current tool of choice. I've fallen in and out of love with
                    Apple over the years, but the current line-up of Mac laptops are irrefutably the best on the market
                    for basically everyone, except from gamers. I currently have the pleasure and fortune of being the
                    owner of an <strong>M1 Pro MacBook Pro</strong>, and two years later, it still gives me enormous
                    pleasure to use.</p>
                <p>Just because I'm a Mac user, that doesn't preclude me from using other operating systems. I tend to
                    prefer <strong>Debian</strong> on headless systems, and either <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> or
                    <strong>Fedora</strong> on PCs.
                </p>
                <p>I'm currently experimenting with <strong>neovim</strong>, but for now my daily code editor is
                    <strong>VS Code</strong>. It is a very dependable editor, and the plugin market is quite mature by
                    now. I do want to get into neovim &ndash; I've been a vimmer for a year or so now, and the
                    keystrokes are second nature to me (I used command-line editors a lot whilst I was a technician).
                </p>
                <p>I cut my teeth on <strong>C/C++</strong> (I know, right‚Ä¶), but I wouldn't consider myself fluent
                    these days. I mainly write in <strong>Perl</strong> &amp; <strong>HTML/SASS/JS</strong> now, though
                    I'm getting familiar with <strong>Java</strong> &amp; <strong>PHP</strong> as well. I'm also a fan
                    of a well-constructed <strong>bash</strong> script. üôÇ</p>
                <p>I'm about to learn <strong>Vue.js</strong> as my first proper framework. Wish me luck! I have dabbled
                    with pseudo-frameworks, like <strong>Jekyll</strong> &amp; <strong>Bootstrap</strong> (which this
                    site uses), and Koha makes use of <strong>JQuery</strong>, but Vue.js feels like a move into the
                    major leagues.</p>
                <p>My only serious foray into the world of databases is with <strong>MySQL</strong> &
                    <strong>Postgres</strong>. I'd love to do stuff with nosql and MongoDB, so if anyone has any
                    interesting pet project ideas, get in touch!
                </p>
                <p>I'm a shameless <strong>/bin/zsh</strong> user, and have a fairly minimal but useful oh-my-zsh setup.
                    Maybe one day, I'll publish my config!</p>
