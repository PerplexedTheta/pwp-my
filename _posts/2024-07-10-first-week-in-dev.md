I started my new job last Monday. I've been really enjoying it so far, and it already feels like I'm beginning to get the hang of things. Imposter's syndrome is apparently all part of the game, and something I definitely feel deep into right at this time (AM is worse, I usually feel a sense of accomplishment by the time PM is upon me).

I have been put on the Koha product, mainly written in Perl with a little TemplateToolkit and JavaScript to tie it together. The product is very old, which is challenging because it has so many quirks and a million moving parts. Still, the bugs I've worked on thus far have been extremely enjoyable to work on -- even if I feel like I need to pick up the pace from time to time ðŸ˜… I've been assured this feeling passes.

I'm hoping to submit code for at least two unstarted patches, this week, as well as to sign off five. Small fry so far, but one has to start somewhere!

Outside of work, we went to Mainsquare in France last week, followed by a day in Paris. It was amazing, I'd highly recommend the festival for those looking to go next year. Placebo were amazing, as were Nothing but Thieves, and Bring me the Horizon. For myself, though, the highlight were The Blaze, a French electronic duo. If you don't know them, check them out!
