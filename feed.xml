I‚Äôve been really enjoying it so far, and it already feels like I‚Äôm beginning to get the hang of things. Imposter‚Äôs syndrome is apparently all part of the game, and something I definitely feel deep into right at this time (AM is worse, I usually feel a sense of accomplishment by the time PM is upon me).</p>

<p>I have been put on the Koha product, mainly written in Perl with a little TemplateToolkit and JavaScript to tie it together. The product is very old, which is challenging because it has so many quirks and a million moving parts. Still, the bugs I‚Äôve worked on thus far have been extremely enjoyable to work on ‚Äì even if I feel like I need to pick up the pace from time to time üòÖ I‚Äôve been assured this feeling passes.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm hoping to submit code for at least two unstarted patches, this week, as well as to sign off five. Small fry so far, but one has to start somewhere!</p>

<p>Outside of work, we went to Mainsquare in France last week, followed by a day in Paris. It was amazing, I‚Äôd highly recommend the festival for those looking to go next year. Placebo were amazing, as were Nothing but Thieves, and Bring me the Horizon. For myself, though, the highlight were The Blaze, a French electronic duo. If you don‚Äôt know them, check them out!</p>

I‚Äôve really enjoyed my time in Infrastructure, and wouldn‚Äôt say I regretted spending time in sysadmin land, but the time has definitely come. We‚Äôve also got a new dev starting on the 8<sup>th</sup> July, so I won‚Äôt be a loner when starting, yay!</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been working on a SASS project again this week, and decided to use Gulp to build the SASS ‚Äúproperly‚Äù. It was a handy experience, which led me to create a simple yet effective <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gulpfile.js</code>:</p>

<p>It isn‚Äôt anything amazing, but I‚Äôm very pleased!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bitmaps/blog/2024-06-26-cat-in-yard.jpg" alt="Stray cat in yard" /></p>

<p>Outside of techiness, we‚Äôve had a stray cat coming in the yard. She‚Äôs hands down the sweetest, chattiest &amp; friendliest cat I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of interacting with ‚Äì and we grew up with cats.</p>

<p>Tragically, she appears to have fallen on hard times. She‚Äôs very skinny, and has terribly matted fur. I‚Äôve been putting food out for her since Monday, and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>If she‚Äôs still around next week, I‚Äôll get her to the vets, and give her a haircut..!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-post" /><category term="cat,gulp,job-change,awesomeness" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I change job next week, have learned the basics of Gulp, and took in a stray]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello, world!</title><link href="/blog/2024/06/20/hello-world.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello, world!" /><published>2024-06-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-06-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/blog/2024/06/20/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2024/06/20/hello-world.html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, world! Hello, world? That‚Äôs lame. Still, welcome to the site. I‚Äôve spent the past two weeks tweaking it, so I hope you like it. I mainly plan on using this site as a place for me to discuss my interests, and share a few snippets of my life.</p>

<p>For the curious, I‚Äôve used Jekyll to build it all ‚Äì an utterly delightful process, I understand the hype! I‚Äôll be putting it on my microserver here at home, to see how much traffic I generate. If I end up burning a hole in my wallet, I‚Äôll ship you lovelies off to Germany to live a peaceful life at Hetzner.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I‚Äôm going to aim to get a post up on here once a week ‚Äì if that proves sustainable, I‚Äôll keep at it, and if that drives me insane, I‚Äôll conversely dial it back. Don‚Äôt expect quality content or thought-provoking diatribe, but I will definitely be revelling in the antics of the general election here in the UK.</p>

<p>Off to the bar now for an alcohol-free gin. Keep the peace, folks! Ciao.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-post" /><category term="hello-world," /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first blog post!]]></summary></entry></feed>
